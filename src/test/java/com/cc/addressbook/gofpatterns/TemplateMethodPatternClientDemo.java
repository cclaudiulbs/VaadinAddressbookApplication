 *         When? When two or more implementations of a similar algorithm exist Its a behavioral pattern, as it's used to
 *         manage algorithms, relantionships, and responsabilities between objects
 * 
 *         From GoF: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, making subclasses implement their specific
 *         behavior based on the skeleton, hence the subclasses can redefine some steps in the algorithm, without
 *         chaning the algorithm structure
 * 
 *         Template Pattern core components: <li>basically works with Abstract Classes -- abstract methods for
 *         delegating/deffering the specific behavior to be Overriden by subclasses <li>a final non-overridable
 *         templateMethod which uses the abstract methods to control the structure of the algorithm, hence the algorithm
 *         is not changed, but deffered to be specifically implemented by every concrete Implementer</li>
 * 
 *         Through polymorphism each method is called at runtime, and its speficic algorithm is invoked, based on the
 *         same structure define by the templateMethod Pattern method
 * 
 *         One more important thing: the Template Method makes use of the Hollywood Principle:
 *         "don't call us! we'll call you" This principle says, that low level components should NOT call/depend
 *         directly on the high-level components, but high-level components should call low-level components to get the
 *         job done; in such way, our Abstract class, holding the Template method will control the overall process by
 *         calling subclasses methods when necessary
 * 
 *         The general algorithm is saved in one place but the concrete steps may be changed by the subclasses.
 * 
 *         let subclasses implement (through method overriding) behavior that can vary avoid duplication in the code:
 *         the general workflow structure is implemented once in the abstract class's algorithm, and necessary
 *         variations are implemented in each of the subclasses. control at what point(s) subclassing is allowed. As
 *         opposed to a simple polymorphic override, where the base method would be entirely rewritten allowing radical
 *         change to the workflow, only the specific details of the workflow are allowed to change.
